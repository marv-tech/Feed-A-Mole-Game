Feed A Mole is a simple game that challenges players to interact with mole images by clicking on them within a specific timeframe. The game revolves around four main states of the mole images, each indicating a different stage of interaction: Hungry, Fed, Sad, and Leaving.

## Game Mechanics

The gameplay consists of two major cycles:

### Cycle 1: Non-Interaction
In this cycle, if a mole is left unclicked for a certain duration, it transitions from its default Hungry state to a Sad state, indicating a missed opportunity for points. After another interval, it progresses to a Leaving state, signifying that the chance to earn points for that mole has passed.

### Cycle 2: Interaction
When a Hungry mole is clicked, it transitions to a Fed state before proceeding to the Leaving state. Clicking on a mole during this phase rewards the player with one point. However, if the clicked mole is a King Mole, the player earns two points instead.

## Types of Moles

There are two distinct types of moles in the game:

1. **Normal Mole**: Clicking on a Normal Mole awards the player with one point.
2. **King Mole**: Clicking on a King Mole rewards the player with two points, making it a more lucrative target for higher scores.

Enjoy the challenge of feeding the moles and aiming for the highest score!
